# HeatMap.js
HeatMap.js is a front-end javascript library that can generate smooth heat maps from a discrete 2D array of numbers. 
This is done efficiently *(on load)*, on the client machine. 
For less powerful client computers, the algorithm can be tuned to run faster with small compromises to the resulting heat map.

Heat maps generated by HeatMap.js require very little storage, as an array of integers takes much less space than an image of similar quality.
As such, they can be loaded by client machines that have very slow internet connections in a small amount of time.

The algorithm that transforms the array into a smooth image treats each value in the array as a coefficient of a 3D bell curve.
The function that generates the color of a pixel in the heat map is the sum of the bell curves in the vicinity of the pixel.

This library could be very useful to local communities, especially in Miami, as it could be used to model dangerous weather events or rent prices.

HeatMap.js relies on p5.js, and that library is included in the default project zip folder. For more information: [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).
